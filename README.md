This repository contains the class materials for the [Research Methods, Data Science, and Mathematics](https://www.lse.ac.uk/study-at-lse/Summer-Schools/Summer-School/Courses/Secure/Research-Methods-Data-Science-and-Mathematics) course [*ME314 Introduction to Data Science and Big Data Analytics*](https://www.lse.ac.uk/study-at-lse/Summer-Schools/Summer-School/Courses/Secure/Research-Methods-Data-Science-and-Mathematics/ME314) taught in July-August 2018 by Kenneth Benoit, Slava Mikhaylov, and Jack Blumenau.  


### Overview

Data Science and Big Data Analytics are exciting new areas that combine scientific inquiry, statistical knowledge, substantive expertise, and computer programming. One of the main challenges for businesses and policy makers when using big data is to find people with the appropriate skills. Good data science requires experts that combine substantive knowledge with data analytical skills, which makes it a prime area for social scientists with an interest in quantitative methods.

This course integrates prior training in quantitative methods (statistics) and coding with substantive expertise and introduces the fundamental concepts and techniques of Data Science and Big Data Analytics.

Typical students will be advanced undergraduate and postgraduate students from any field requiring the fundamentals of data science or working with typically large datasets and databases. Practitioners from industry, government, or research organisations with some basic training in quantitative analysis or computer programming are also welcome. Because this course surveys diverse techniques and methods, it makes an ideal foundation for more advanced or more specific training. Our applications are drawn from social, political, economic, legal, and business and marketing fields.

### Objectives

This course aims to provide an introduction to the data science approach to the quantitative analysis of data using the methods of statistical learning, an approach blending classical statistical methods with recent advances in computational and machine learning. We will cover the main analytical methods from this field with hands-on applications using example datasets, so that students gain experience with and confidence in using the methods we cover. We also cover data preparation and processing, including working with structured databases, key-value formatted data (JSON), and unstructured textual data. At the end of this course students will have a sound understanding of the field of data science, the ability to analyse data using some of its main methods, and a solid foundation for more advanced or more specialised study.  

The course will be delivered as a series of morning lectures, followed by lab sessions in the afternoon where students will apply the lessons in a series of instructor-guided exercises using data provided as part of the exercises. The course will cover the following topics:

- an overview of data science and the challenge of working with big data using statistical methods  
- how to integrate the insights from data analytics into knowledge generation and decision-making  
- how to acquire data, both structured and unstructured, and to process it, store it, and convert it into a format suitable for analysis  
- approaches to normalising data, using a database manager (SQLite), and working with SQL database queries  
- the basics of statistical inference including probability and probability distributions, modelling, experimental design  
- an overview of classification methods and related methods for assessing model fit and cross-validating predictive models  
- supervised learning approaches, including linear and logistic regression, decision trees, and na√Øve Bayes  
- unsupervised learning approaches, including clustering, association rules, and principal components analysis  
- quantitative methods of text analysis, including mining social media and other online resources  
- social network analysis, covering the basics of social graph data and analysing social networks  
- data visualisation through a variety of graphs.  


### Prerequisites

Students should already be familiar with quantitative methods at an introductory level, up to linear regression analysis. Familiarity with computer programming or database structures is a benefit, but not formally required.


### Preparing for the course

Before the course you should:

* Download and install [R](https://cran.r-project.org) _and_ [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com) on your computer.

If you are not already familiar with R, we strongly encourage you to attempt to become familiar before the start of the course.  That way, you will spend much less time become familiar with the tools, and be able to focus more on the methods.  The following links provide a basic introduction to R, which you can study at your own pace before the course begins.

* [*An Introduction to R*](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.pdf).
* Data Camp [R tutorials](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r).
* Data Camp [R Markdown tutorials](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/reporting-with-r-markdown), first chapter.
* [R Codeschool](http://tryr.codeschool.com/).

We strongly recommend you spend some of July and August before the course working through the following materials:

* Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham (2016) _R for Data Science_, O'Reilly Media. Note: Online version is available from the authors' page [here](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html).
* James et al. (2013) _An Introduction to Statistical Learning: With applications in R_, Springer, Chapters 1--2. Note: The book is available from the authors' page [here](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/).

If you start preparing for the course (with the above materials) using your own laptop, it may be more convenient for you to continue using it during the summer school.

### Important Specifics

#### Computer Software

Computer-based exercises will feature prominently in the course, especially in the lab sessions.  The use of all software tools will be explained in the sessions, including how to download and install them.  All of the class work will be done using R, using publicly available packages.

#### Instructions for Submitting Homeworks

Each homework will be a single file in the [RMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) format.  The files linked below are *named very carefully*, to make it easy for us to identify your completed lab assignments.  

1.  Obtaining the starter files.  

    Each day below will link the name of a starter file for you to download and work with.  These are in the RMarkdown format.  You should embed your answers, with code, into your version of the instruction files.

2.  Renaming the starter files.  

    For example, the first assignment file is named `ME314_assignment1_LASTNAME_FIRSTNAME.Rmd`, which you will need to rename by replacing the uppercase terms with your own last and first names, e.g.  `ME314_assignment1_Bloggs_Joe.Rmd`.

3.  From RStudio, you can create an HTML output file with your evaluated code, figure, and text answers by clicking the "Knit HTML" button in the top of the editor pane in RStudio.  The resulting HTML file will be saved in your working directory.

4.  You will need to upload the resulting HTML file -- renamed! -- to the [course Moodle page](https://shortcourses.lse.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=158), to the appropriate assignment folder.  

We will walk you through this process in the Day 1 lab, so don't worry if it seems complicated the first time.  This sort of careful workflow process and file management is part of learning practical data science too!

We do not mark the homework but we will walk through the solutions at the start of computer labs the following day.


#### Instructions for use of course materials

You have three options for downloading the course material found on this page:  

1.  You can download the materials by clicking on each link.  

2.  You can "clone" repository, using the buttons found to the right side of your browser window as you view this repository.  This is the button labelled "Clone in Desktop".  If you do not have a git client installed on your system, you will need to [get one here](https://git-scm.com/download/gui) and also to make sure that [git is installed](https://git-scm.com/downloads).  This is preferred, since you can refresh your clone as new content gets pushed to the course repository.  (And new material will get actively pushed to the course repository at least once per day as this course takes place.)

3.  Statically, you can choose the button on the right marked "Download zip" which will download the entire repository as a zip file.

You can also subscribe to the repository if you have [a GitHub account](https://github.com), which will send you updates each time new changes are pushed to the repository.
